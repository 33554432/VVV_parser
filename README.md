# VVV_parser
Takes large viva view file sets and pushes them around.
This script takes files from the Olympus VivaView using MetaMorph and organizes them into subfolders based on filter (GFP, RFP, and DIC) as well as stage position (ie, you'll get folders like GFP_S1 or GFP_SAMPLE1_S1 as the output). If you did not check the "Break up into multiple files based on sample loader position" box you will need to know the total number of stage positions and total number of plates (ex. 4 plates with 3 positions each means 12 stage positions). It will now also work if you checked "Break up into multiple files based on sample loader position" and for this option you should use the max number of stage positions used on any of the plates (ex 4 plates with 1 position per plate except for one that has 3, use 3 as your max number of stage positions).
