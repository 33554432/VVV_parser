# VVV_parser
Takes large viva view file sets and pushes them around.
This script takes files from the Olympus VivaView using MetaMorph and organizes them into subfolders based on filter (GFP, RFP, and DIC) as well as stage position (ie, you'll get folders like GFP_S1 as the output). You should calculate the number of stage positions as the number of stage positions per plate, times the number of plates. So if you have 3 stage positions and 4 plates, the number of stage positions is 12. It will now also work if you checked "Break up into multiple files based on sample loader position" and for this option you should use the max number of stage positions used on one plate.
